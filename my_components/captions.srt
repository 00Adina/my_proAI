00:00:08,205 --> 00:00:10,939
you've got." Janis Joplin

with what is good and bad

and with moral duty and obligations

accepted standards of conduct

11
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:30,167
Ethical Reasoning. The process of sorting

12
00:00:30,167 --> 00:00:32,614
out the principles that help determine

13
00:00:32,614 --> 00:00:35,062
what is ethical when faced with

14
00:00:35,062 --> 00:00:37,509
an ethical dilemma

15
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:40,294
Ethical System. A specific formula for

16

more ethical systems, or which is

20
00:00:50,639 --> 00:00:53,159
counter to an accepted ethical value,

21
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:55,679
such as honesty

22
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,188
Non-ethical Considerations. Powerful human motivations that

23
00:00:59,188 --> 00:01:02,696
are not based on right or

24
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:06,204
wrong, but on considerations of survival

25
00:01:06,204 --> 00:01:09,712
and well-being, such as health, security,

26
00:01:09,712 --> 00:01:13,219
love, wealth, or selfesteem

27
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:16,516
Ethical Dilemma. This is an ethical

28
00:01:16,516 --> 00:01:19,813
problem in which the ethical choice

29
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:23,109
involves ignoring a powerful non-ethical consideration.

30
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:25,465
Ethical Alarms. “Ethics alarms are the

31
00:01:25,465 --> 00:01:27,820
feelings in your gut, the twinges

32
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,176
in your conscience, and the sense

33
00:01:30,176 --> 00:01:32,531
of caution in your brain when

34
00:01:32,531 --> 00:01:34,886
situations involving choices of right and

35
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:37,242
wrong are beginning to develop, fast

36
00:01:37,242 --> 00:01:39,597
approaching, or unavoidable.” The better your

37
00:01:39,597 --> 00:01:41,953
ethics alarm is working and the

38
00:01:41,953 --> 00:01:44,308
sooner your alarm goes off the

39
00:01:44,308 --> 00:01:46,663
more likely you are to do

40
00:01:46,663 --> 00:01:49,019
the right thing, or at least

41
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:51,374
use good ethical reasoning to decide

42
00:01:51,374 --> 00:01:53,730
what to do.

43
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,307
The Importance of Ethical Conduct in

44
00:01:56,307 --> 00:01:58,884
Business. The field of business ethics

45
00:01:58,884 --> 00:02:01,461
often overlaps and informs ethical decision

46
00:02:01,461 --> 00:02:04,038
making for engineers. your business dealings.

47
00:02:04,038 --> 00:02:06,615
The company‟s reputation is in your

48
00:02:06,615 --> 00:02:09,192
hands and it therefore depends on

49
00:02:09,192 --> 00:02:11,769
you to do the right thing

50
00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:14,346
in the best interests of the

51
00:02:14,346 --> 00:02:16,923
organization. High standards in business conduct

52
00:02:16,923 --> 00:02:19,500
will go a long way to

53
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,077
meriting the confidence and support of

54
00:02:22,077 --> 00:02:24,655
your clients and employers. While business

55
00:02:24,655 --> 00:02:27,232
practices may change over time, our

56
00:02:27,232 --> 00:02:29,809
commitment to the highest standards of

57
00:02:29,809 --> 00:02:32,386
integrity should remain constant and unblemished.

58
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:34,963
Conducting business ethically is critical to

59
00:02:34,963 --> 00:02:37,540
success in the marketplace. It means

60
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,117
more than obeying the law; it

61
00:02:40,117 --> 00:02:42,694
means that high standards of integrity

62
00:02:42,694 --> 00:02:45,271
must underlie every activity we undertake.

63
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:47,848
It is up to the engineer

64
00:02:47,848 --> 00:02:50,425
to apply these guidelines to the

65
00:02:50,425 --> 00:02:53,002
best of their ability in their

66
00:02:53,002 --> 00:02:55,579
own individual situation.

67
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:58,504
Professional Ethics. In life our behavior

68
00:02:58,504 --> 00:03:01,428
is governed by different norm systems.

69
00:03:01,428 --> 00:03:04,352
The word NORM comes from Latin

70
00:03:04,352 --> 00:03:07,277
“NORMA”= yardstick. Norms dictate what we

71
00:03:07,277 --> 00:03:10,201
“ought” or “ought not” to do.

72
00:03:10,201 --> 00:03:13,125
The norm systems governing the behaviour

73
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:16,049
of a professional are:

74
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:18,788
Individual morality. Refers to individual values

75
00:03:18,788 --> 00:03:21,527
of a specific person and what

76
00:03:21,527 --> 00:03:24,266
they believe to be right. Individual

77
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:27,004
morality is influenced by how a

78
00:03:27,004 --> 00:03:29,743
person was raised. It is their

79
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:32,482
personal value system. The sanction for

80
00:03:32,482 --> 00:03:35,221
disobeying one‟s individual morality is a

81
00:03:35,221 --> 00:03:37,959
guilty conscience.

82
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:40,753
Positive morality. This set of norms

83
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:43,547
represents what is considered “right” in

84
00:03:43,547 --> 00:03:46,341
society at a particular time. The

85
00:03:46,341 --> 00:03:49,135
sanction for failure to obey positive

86
00:03:49,135 --> 00:03:51,929
morality is social sanction.

87
00:03:51,929 --> 00:03:55,684
Law (Legal Norms). Laws protect society

88
00:03:55,684 --> 00:03:59,439
and prevent anarchy by regulating behavior.

89
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,576
Public Law. also referred to as

90
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:03,713
criminal law: between the state and

91
00:04:03,713 --> 00:04:05,849
individual.

92
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:08,426
Private Law. also referred to as

93
00:04:08,426 --> 00:04:11,003
contractual law and focuses on the

94
00:04:11,003 --> 00:04:13,579
relationship between persons.
