Languages that programmers use to write code are called “high-level languages.” This code can be compiled into a “low-level language,” which is recognized directly by the computer hardware.",
        "There are two types of programming languages, which can be categorized into the following ways:",
        "Low-level language is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction of programming concepts and is very close to writing actual machine instructions. Two examples of low-level languages are assembly and machine code.",
        "High-level language is a programming language that is more user-friendly, to some extent platform-independent, and abstract from low-level computer processor operations such as memory access. Examples: C++, Java, Python, etc."
